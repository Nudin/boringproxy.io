I want to enable people to host their own software and control their data. I've
identified the following primary obstacles:

* Getting and using a domain name should be as easy as a phone number.

* It should be easy to use your own computers to host content on the internet.

boringproxy is currently working to solve the second problem, and may
eventually be able to solve the first.
